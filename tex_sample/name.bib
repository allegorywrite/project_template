abstract = {This paper investigates the distributed Kalman filtering (DKF) from distributed optimization viewpoint. Motivated by the fact that Kalman filtering is a maximum a posteriori estimation (MAP) problem, which is a quadratic optimization problem, we reformulate DKF problem as a consensus optimization problem, resulting in that it can be solved by many existing distributed optimization algorithms. A new DKF algorithm employing the dual ascent method is proposed, and its stability is proved under mild assumptions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through numerical experiments.}

 abstract = { A fully updated textbook on linear systems theory Linear systems theory is the cornerstone of control theory and a well-established discipline that focuses on linear differential equations from the perspective of control and estimation. This updated second edition of Linear Systems Theory covers the subject's key topics in a unique lecture-style format, making the book easy to use for instructors and students. João Hespanha looks at system representation, stability, controllability and state feedback, observability and state estimation, and realization theory. He provides the background for advanced modern control design techniques and feedback linearization and examines advanced foundational topics, such as multivariable poles and zeros and LQG/LQR. The textbook presents only the most essential mathematical derivations and places comments, discussion, and terminology in sidebars so that readers can follow the core material easily and without distraction. Annotated proofs with sidebars explain the techniques of proof construction, including contradiction, contraposition, cycles of implications to prove equivalence, and the difference between necessity and sufficiency. Annotated theoretical developments also use sidebars to discuss relevant commands available in MATLAB, allowing students to understand these tools. This second edition contains a large number of new practice exercises with solutions. Based on typical problems, these exercises guide students to succinct and precise answers, helping to clarify issues and consolidate knowledge. The book's balanced chapters can each be covered in approximately two hours of lecture time, simplifying course planning and student review.  Easy-to-use textbook in unique lecture-style format Sidebars explain topics in further detail Annotated proofs and discussions of MATLAB commands Balanced chapters can each be taught in two hours of course lecture New practice exercises with solutions included  },

abstract = {We propose a general purpose variational inference algorithm that forms a natural counterpart of gradient descent for optimization. Our method iteratively transports a set of particles to match the target distribution, by applying a form of functional gradient descent that minimizes the KL divergence. Empirical studies are performed on various real world models and datasets, on which our method is competitive with existing state-of-the-art methods. The derivation of our method is based on a new theoretical result that connects the derivative of KL divergence under smooth transforms with Stein's identity and a recently proposed kernelized Stein discrepancy, which is of independent interest.},
